# 4D Rubik's Cube

This is the C code to render and run a 4D Rubik's Cube in browsers!

I tried to use minimal JavaScript (just for keyboard input) and let the C code do the heavy lifting.

Started project on June 20, 2024. Finished on June 27, 2024. 
(will still make improvements and quality of life improvements though!)
